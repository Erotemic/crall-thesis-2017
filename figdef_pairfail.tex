Incomparable Pairwise failure case
}{
% ---
The pair is incomparable, but the classifier predicts negative due to the small
amount of incomparable training data available.

\SingleImageCommand{PairFailNP}{1}{
Negative pairwise failure case
}{
% ---
This pair is negative, but the classifier predicts positive because of
similarity in pose and coarse patterns. The classifier is unable to recognize
that the shoulder is the same region on both animals and contains distinctive
patterns that do not match.
